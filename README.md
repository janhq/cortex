## About
Cortex is an OpenAI-compatible AI engine that developers can use to build LLM apps. It is packaged with a Docker-inspired command-line interface and client libraries. It can be used as a standalone server or imported as a library. 

Cortex currently supports 3 inference engines:

- Llama.cpp
- ONNX Runtime
- TensorRT-LLM

## Quickstart
### Prerequisites
Ensure that your system meets the following requirements to run Cortex:
- **Dependencies**:
  - **Node.js**: version 18 and above is required to run the installation.
  - **NPM**: Needed to manage packages.
  - **CPU Instruction Sets**: Available for download from the [Cortex GitHub Releases](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/releases) page.
- **OS**:

> Visit [Quickstart](https://cortex.jan.ai/docs/quickstart) to get started.

### NPM
``` bash
# Install using NPM
npm i -g cortexso
# Install using Brew
brew tap janhq/cortexso
brew install cortexso
# Run model
cortex run llama3
# To uninstall globally using NPM
npm uninstall -g cortexso
```

### Homebrew
``` bash
# Install using Brew
brew tap janhq/cortexso
brew install cortexso
# Run model
cortex run llama3
# To uninstall using Brew
brew uninstall cortexso
brew untap janhq/cortexso
```
> You can also install Cortex using the Cortex Installer available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/releases).

To run Cortex as an API server:
```bash
cortex serve

# Output
# Started server at http://localhost:1337
# Swagger UI available at http://localhost:1337/api
```

You can now access the Cortex API server at `http://localhost:1337`,
and the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:1337/api`.
