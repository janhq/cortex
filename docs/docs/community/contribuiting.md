Nitro is our way to hopefully help to create open source fast, lightweight and embeddable inference engine. We currently the engine powered [Jan](https://jan.ai/). If you're interested in contributing to Nitro, hopefully, this document makes the process for contributing clear.

Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

## Code of Conduct
Please read our [Code of Conduct](coc) to understand the community guidelines and expectations.

## Get Involved
There are many ways to contribute to Nitro, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Simply start using Nitro. Go through the [Getting Started](nitro/overview) guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/issues).
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/issues). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help triage issues.
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/pulls). Issues tagged as `Good` first issue are a good place to get started.
- Read through the Nitro documentation. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can click "Edit this page" at the bottom of most docs, which takes you to the GitHub interface to make and propose changes.
- Take a look at the features requested by others in the community and consider opening a [pull request]((https://github.com/janhq/nitro/pulls)) if you see something you want to work on.
Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FTk2MvZwJH) and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.

### Triaging Issues and Pull Requests
One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest [labels](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/labels) that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.

### Create issues
When encountering issues with Nitro, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/janhq/nitro) issue. Include detailed information like error logs and steps to reproduce the issue.

### Feature requests
Submit feature requests via [Nitro offcial Github](https://github.com/janhq/nitro). Check existing requests to avoid duplicates. Describe your request clearly, and explain its potential benefits.

### Pull Request Guidelines
Submit one Pull Request per day, with a clear description. Follow the project's code style and structure. Refrain from reformatting or refactoring. Non-compliant Pull Requests will be rejected.
