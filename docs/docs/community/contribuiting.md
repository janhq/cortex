- For New Contributors, please check out [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for a general guide on open-source contribution.

## Code of Conduct
Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](coc) to understand the rules and expectations in our community.

## Get Involved
There are many ways to contribute to Nitro, and not all involve coding. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Begin by going through the [Getting Started](nitro/overview) guide. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/issues).

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/issues). You can offer workarounds, clarification, or suggest labels to help organize issues. If you find an issue you’d like to resolve, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/pulls). Start with issues tagged as `Good first issue`.

- Read through Nitro's documentation. If something is confusing or can be improved, click “Edit this page” at the bottom of most docs to propose changes directly on GitHub.

- Check out feature requests from the community. You can contribute by opening a [pull request](https://github.com/janhq/nitro/pulls) for something you’re interested in working on.
