:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

## Overview
For Windows, Cortex.cpp can be installed in two ways:
- [Windows](#windows)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-linux)

## Windows
### Install Cortex.cpp
Cortex.cpp offers two installer types:
- Network Installers download a minimal system and require an internet connection to fetch packages during installation.
- Local Installers include all necessary packages, enabling offline installation without internet access.
:::info
Before installation, make sure that you have met the required [dependencies](#dependencies) and [hardware](#hardware) to run Cortex.
:::
- Stable: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
- Beta: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
- Nightly: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
#### Data Folder
By default, Cortex.cpp is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\cortexcpp

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
C:\Users\<username>\.cortexcpp
```
### Uninstall Cortex.cpp
To uninstall Cortex.cpp:
1. Navigate to **Add or Remove program**.
2. Search for Cortex.cpp and click **Uninstall**.
## Windows Subsystem Linux
:::info
Windows Subsystem Linux allows running Linux tools and workflows seamlessly alongside Windows applications. For more information, please see this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).

- Local Installers include all necessary packages, enabling offline installation without internet access.
:::info
Before installation, make sure that you have met the required [dependencies](#dependencies) and [hardware](#hardware) to run Cortex.
:::
1. Download the Windows installer:
    - Stable: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
    - Beta: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
    - Nightly: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
2. Ensure that Cortex.cpp is sucessfulyy installed:
```bash
# Stable
cortex.exe

# Beta
cortex-beta.exe

# Nightly
cortex-nightly.exe
```

#### Data Folder
By default, Cortex.cpp is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\cortexcpp\cortex<env>.exe

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
C:\Users\<username>\.cortexcpp<env>
```
### Uninstall Cortex.cpp
Run the uninstaller script:
```bash
# Stable version
sudo apt remove cortexcpp

# Beta version
sudo apt remove cortexcpp-beta

# Nightly version
sudo apt remove cortexcpp-nightly
```
## Build from Source

1. Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).
2. Navigate to the `engine > vcpkg` folder.
3. Configure the vpkg:

```bash
cd vcpkg
## Windows
./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
## WSL
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
vcpkg install
```
4. Build the Cortex.cpp inside the `build` folder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
## Windows
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
## WSL
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
make -j4
```
5. Use Visual Studio with the C++ development kit to build the project using the files generated in the `build` folder.
6. Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```

## Prerequisites
### Dependencies
#### Windows
- Node.js version 18 and higher
- NPM
#### Windows Subsystem for Linux

### Hardware
#### Operating System
- Windows 10 or higher.
#### CPU
:::info
- Cortex.cpp supports a processor that can handle AVX2. For the full list, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX2).
- We support older processors with AVX and AVX-512, though this is not recommended.
:::
##### Intel CPU
- Haswell processors (Q2 2013) and newer.
- Tiger Lake (Q3 2020) and newer for Celeron and Pentium processors.
##### AMD CPU
- Excavator processors (Q2 2015) and newer.
#### RAM
:::info
We support DDR2 RAM as the minimum requirement but recommend using newer generations of RAM for improved performance.
:::
- 8GB for running up to 3B models (int4).
- 16GB for running up to 7B models (int4).
- 32GB for running up to 13B models (int4).
#### GPU
:::info
Having at least 6GB VRAM when using NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel Arc GPUs is recommended.
:::
- 6GB can load the 3B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 8GB can load the 7B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 12GB can load the 13B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
