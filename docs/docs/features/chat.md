The Chat Completion feature in Nitro provides a flexible way to interact with any local Large Language Model (LLM).

### Single Request Example

To send a single query to your chosen LLM, follow these steps:

<div class="code-snippet-left">

```bash title="Nitro"
curl http://localhost:3928/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      },
    ]
  }'

```

</div>

<div class="code-snippet-right">

```bash title="OpenAI"
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

</div>

This command sends a request to your local LLM, querying about the winner of the 2020 World Series.

### Dialog Request Example

For ongoing conversations or multiple queries, the dialog request feature is ideal. Hereâ€™s how to structure a multi-turn conversation:

<div class="code-snippet-left">

```bash title="Nitro"
curl http://localhost:3928/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Where was it played?"
      }
    ]
  }'

```

</div>

<div class="code-snippet-right">

```bash title="OpenAI"
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Where was it played?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

</div>
