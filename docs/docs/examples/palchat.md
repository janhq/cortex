## What is Pal - AI Chat Client?

## Using Pal with Nitro

**1. Start Nitro server**

Open your terminal:
```bash title="Run Nitro"
nitro
```

**2. Download Model**

Use these commands to download and save the [Llama2 7B chat model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/tree/main):

```bash title="Get a model"
mkdir model && cd model
wget -O llama-2-7b-model.gguf https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf
```

> For more GGUF model, please look at [The Bloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

**3. Run the Model**

To load the model, use the following command:

```bash title="Load model to the server"
curl http://localhost:3928/inferences/llamacpp/loadmodel \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "llama_model_path": "model/llama-2-7b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf",
    "ctx_len": 512,
    "ngl": 100,
  }'
```

**4. Configure Pal Chat**

In the `OpenAI API Key` field, just type any random text (e.g. key-xxxxxx).

Adjust the `provide custom host` setting under `advanced settings` in Pal Chat with your LAN IPv4 address (a series of numbers like 192.xxx.x.xxx).
