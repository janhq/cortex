:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

# `cortex models start`

This command starts a model defined by a `model_id`.



## Usage

```bash
# Start a model
cortex models start [model_id]

# Start a model with a preset
cortex models start [model_id] [options]

# Start with a specified engine
cortex models start [model_id]:[engine] [options]
```


:::info
- This command uses a `model_id` from the model that you have downloaded or available in your file system.
- Model preset is applied only at the start of the model and does not change during the chat session.
